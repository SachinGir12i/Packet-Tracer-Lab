# Packet-Tracer-Lab
Its a mega lab containing the protocols that I have learned from CCNA.
  I built and fine-tuned a detailed network setup in Cisco Packet Tracer, diving into core CCNA concepts I’ve been learning. I got hands-on with OSPF to manage dynamic routing, set up VLANs to organize network traffic, and even tackled inter-VLAN routing to keep everything connected smoothly. To round it out, I configured static and default routes, played around with NAT to handle IP addresses, and set up ACLs to lock down security. This project wasn’t just about ticking boxes—it taught me how to troubleshoot real-world hiccups and gave me a solid feel for how networks actually work beyond the textbook.
